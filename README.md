## Initial Thoughts

This project will be about using an external API. From the surface this looks like its going to be
really interesting. I am so grateful the Ruby gems exist. As of now they seem to be making my life alot
simpler. I guess that is their intended purpose after all.

## Final Thoughts

In the very beginning I hit a roadblock trying to set an environment variable but it was figured out after I saw a
helpful YouTube video. This project was so much more confusing until I realized the API methods could be called on
the Flickr object brought to me by the gem. GOSH am I grateful for that Flickr gem. Once I figured that out I was
able to figure out which API method to use. Things did start to get scary though when I started putting in random
user ids and seeing random photos of people. I don't want to do that again. Overall, this was a fun short project.
I am looking forward to discovering my own APIs in the future!
